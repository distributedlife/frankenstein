    <title>Customizing Frankenstein</title>

<h3>Extending the core test vocabulary</h3>
Frankenstein is an event-driven framework. It is possible to extend the core event vocabulary by creating new event classes.
Custom events need to implement the <code>FrankensteinEvent</code> interface. (For most custom events, it will be sufficient to
extend from <code>AbstractFrankensteinEvent</code>). You'll need to explicitly register a custom event with Frankenstein
<h3>Custom components</h3>
Custom components will require custom recorders to be written.

Most component recorders work in the following manner:
<ul>
    <li>Attach a component specific listener when a component is shown (for example, the textComponentRecorder attaches a document listener)<li>
    <li>Record a custom event when the component specific listener is triggered.</li>
    <li>Detach the listener when the component is hidden.It is critical to ensure that your listeners get detached at the right time to avoid memory leaks</li>
</ul>
<h3>What to record</h3>
Let's look at what it would take to write a custom recorder for a Map widget, where the user can select locations on a map.
It would be advisable to avoid recording raw mouse coordinates. <br>Which would you prefer?<br><br>
<code>Click map 100,100</code>, or<br>
<code>Click map Bangalore, 83E 92N</code>?<br><br>
Transforming low level actions into high level events:
<ul>
    <li>Allows tests to be readable and meaningful</li>
    <li>The tests tend to be relatively stable. Coordinate based testing is notorious for creating fragile tests.</li>
</ul>
