Frankenstein makes it easy to test applications that use Worker Threads. By definition, worker threads are
usually spawned as the result of a user action. At the end of every step, Frankenstein waits until all worker thread
activity ceases.
</p>
<p>
The basic approach is to:
<ul>
    <li>Choose a Worker Thread naming convention. (For example you could choose a naming convention that names all worker
        threads with a prefix and a counter: <code>UIWorker-1</code>, <code>UIWorker-2</code>, etc.)</li>
    <li>Create a regular expression that matches the naming convention</li>
    <li>Create a <code>RegexWorkerThreadMonitor</code> with the regular expression, and supply it to
        a <code>FrankensteinIntegration</code> instance</li>
</ul>

Another way of doing this would be to implement the <code>WorkerThreadMonitor</code> interface.
