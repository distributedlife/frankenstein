    <title>Integrating Frankenstein</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>
    The application under test is likely to be launched by a shell script or batch file.
    In order to integrate, Frankenstein, you'll need to locate the line in the script that launches the application under test. This will typically look like this<br>
          <code>java ... com.your.package.Application</code><br>
          Change this to look like this:<br>
          <code>java ... com.thoughtworks.frankenstein.application.PipingMain com.your.package.Application</code><br>
<p>
<p>In case the application under test requires custom events and / or custom recorders, then you'll need to
    write your own main class. You'll then need to change the line that looks like<br>
    <code>java ... com.your.package.Application</code><br>
    to look this:<br>
    <code>java ... com.your.custom.FrankensteinMain com.your.package.Application</code>
